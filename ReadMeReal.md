## Installation

You will need to install the iquirer package.

- Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

You will also need to install the node modules found with npm init.

## Usage

Using your terminal to answer questions will creates a dynamic Read Me file. This is helpful for any developer who wants to streamline their production. This was very interesting to program and offered great challenges to think through. My favorite challenge was how to create a table of contents if and only if the user wanted one. Below you can see how I made that option appear or not in the Read Me file.
